# Interview project

Project used to make interview examples. 
I tried to setup this project as I would in a professional setting. I started with a web project that are the same or similar to the ones used at Spider Strategies. The project was to make an online receipe book, complete with login, search, adding, updating and deleting different foods. Using H2 as a testable database, Spring boot as the web server, and then using jquery and datatable for the presentation layer, talking to the application through Spring Rest.
I did not get as far as I would have liked, but what I have completed is worked through how everything would be setup, except for logging. How the connection to the database would work (tables, columns, foreign keys, etc.), setup the tables, how Spring would communicate through the database, and how to pass the information to the webpage. So I was able to tell that with raw Rest calls, that the controllers were working properly, and I ran out of time making things more dynamic with jQuery.
Hopefully, this is what you were hoping to take a look at.
